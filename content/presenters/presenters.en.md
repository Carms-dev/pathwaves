          to carve a dialogue between sound and tangible matter. Shaped by his
          work within the fields of cinema, literature, dance and theatre
          companies, his own language blend together elements of music,
          photography, design, science, video art, architecture, light design
          and scenography. In the midst of this eclecticism, concerns remain
          constant: the balance between the cerebral and the sensual. Awardee of

          his work widely recognize, presented all over the world. He is
          teaching in the Digital Music program of the Université de Montréal."
