### PURPOSE

As a participant, you will be asked to answer questions about changes that are affecting the music landscape in Canada, including opportunities and barriers to participation with digital technologies. It will inform the content and curriculum of the Pathwaves incubator, a partnership between Envision Management, The Phi Centre, and OCAD University. This research is being conducted by OCAD University, under the supervision of Suzanne Stein, Director, Super Ordinary Lab at OCAD U.

Overall Goals of the Pathwaves incubator:

* To explore the following themes from the perspective of digital innovation or disruption, specifically recorded music, live music performance and creative process.
* To empower artists to drive and dialogue with technological developments challenging systemic inequality and inaccessibility in current models.
* To identify potential opportunities.
* To prototype new models for a more equitable model of creation, production and distribution.

### WHAT’S INVOLVED

As a participant, you will be asked to answer questions about changes that are affecting the music landscape in Canada, including opportunities and barriers to participation with digital technologies.

Participation will take approximately 20 minutes of your time.

### POTENTIAL BENEFITS

Possible benefits of participation include curriculum development for the incubator as well as further research into areas of concern and interest. Results will help us understand the changing environment of the Music Industry in Canada. We aim to understand how technologies may help musicians in Canada in their experimentation in recorded music,  live performance,and creative processes.

### POTENTIAL RISKS

There also may be risks associated with participation, which are social in nature. Social risks include feeling or possibly experiencing a loss in status due to the disclosures on issues facing inclusion or exclusion in a thriving music industry in Canada, as well as identifying potential discomforts with technologies. These concerns are addressed in the design of the study, which is anonymous and administered through OCAD University’s secure server. Only researchers named will have access to the data produced.
