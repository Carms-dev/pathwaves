name: Envision
description: We are an artist management and creative production company that
  works with boundary-breaking, musical and multidisciplinary artists,
  productions and organizations. We support the creation of records, live shows
  and tours, as well as more experimental cross-disciplinary works that
  interface with theatre, film, puppetry and digital technologies. We work with
  artists on new works as they move from conceptualization, through development,
  into production on to dissemination, worldwide.
