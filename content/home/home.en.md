sectionSurvey:
  header: The Pathwaves Survey
  descriptionLeft: The initiative begins with the Pathwaves Survey, a nation-wide
    scan open to anyone operating in Canada’s music industry. Its intent is to
    listen to a diversity of perspectives on the industry, especially as they
    pertain to digital tools and services. The survey results will inform the
    issues tackled during the Incubator and the outcomes which will be shared
    with the public.
  descriptionRight: "Those active in the Canadian music industry, working in all
    genres, from all geographies, of all origins, at all stages of their careers
    (emerging, mid-career, and established), and especially members from
    underrepresented communities, including, but not limited to, BIPOC,
    2SLGBTQ+, newcomers, and people with disabilities, are invited to
    contribute. "
  preLinkText: The short survey will be open from August 9th to September 24th.
