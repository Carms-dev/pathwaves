    In this time of profound change and reflection, the **Pathwaves Digital
    Literacy Incubator — a groundbreaking three-phase virtual development
    program — is seeking applications from Canadian musicians who want to help
    shape the future of the music industry**. By empowering a diversity of
    musicians to harness the opportunities of the digital era, and elevating
    their voices as leaders, Pathwaves aim to make lifelong careers in music
    more possible and equitable. 


    Delivered virtually from January to March 2022, the Pathwaves Incubator consists of conferences, mentorship, master classes, workshops, individual work, and knowledge-exchange — an initiative produced by **Envision Management & Production** in partnership with the **Phi Centre** and **OCAD University**, with financial support from the **Canada Council for the Arts**.


    A cohort of 18 musicians reflecting the many axes of diversity in this country will be selected and paid for their participation. Together they will dive into today’s new technologies — from streaming software and VR live shows to NFTs and AI-assisted composition — with the goal of sparking new solutions-oriented thought surrounding the creation and sharing of music.

    Disabilities, are invited to apply at Pathwaves.ca.
